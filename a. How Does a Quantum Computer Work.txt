a classical computer performs operations

using classical bits which can be either

zero or one now in contrast a quantum

computer uses Quantum bits or Q bits and

they can be both zero and one at the

same time and it is this that gives a

quantum computer its Superior computing

power there are a number of physical

objects that can be used as a cubit a

single Photon a nucleus or an electron I

met up with researchers who are used

using the outermost electron in

phosphorus as a cubit but how does that

work well all electrons have magnetic

fields so they're basically like tiny

bar magnets and this property is called

spin if you place them in a magnetic

field they will align with that field

just like a compass needle lines up with

the magnetic field of the earth now this

is the lowest energy state so you could

call it the zero state or we call it for

the electron spin down now you can put

it in a one state or spin up but that

takes some energy if you took out the

glass from your compass you could turn

the needle the other way but you would

have to apply some Force to it you have

to push it to flip to the other side and

that is the highest energy state in

principle if you were so delicate to

really put it exactly against the

magnetic field it would stay there now

so far this is basically just like a

classical bit it's got two states spin

up and spin down which are like the

classical one and zero

but the funny thing about Quantum

objects is that they can be in both

States at once now when you measure the

spin it will be either up or down but

before you measure it the electron can

exist in what's called a Quantum

superposition where these coefficients

indicate the relative probability of

finding the electron in one State or the

other now it's hard to imagine how this

enables the incredible computing power

of quantum computers without considering

two interacting Quantum bits hello hi

now there are four possible states of

these two electrons you could think that

well that's just like two bits of a

classical computer right if you have two

bits you can write 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 right

there four

numbers but these are still just two

bits of information right all I need to

say to determine which one of the four

numbers you have in your computer code

is the value of the first bit and the

value of the second bit

right here

instead quantum mechanics allows me to

make

superposition of each one of these four

states so I can write a quantum

mechanical state which is perfectly

legitimate that is some coefficient

times this plus some coefficient times

that plus some coefficient times that

plus some

coefficient so to determine the state of

this two spin system I need to give you

four numbers four coefficients whereas

in the classical example of the two bits

I only need to give you two

bits so this is how you understand why

two cubits actually contain four bits of

information I need to give you four

numbers to tell you the state of this

system whereas here I only need two now

if we made three spins we would have

eight different states and need to give

you eight different numbers to define

the state of those three spins whereas

class is just three bits if you keep

going what you'll find is that the

amount of equivalent classical

information contained by n cubits is 2

to the power n classical

bits and of course the power of

exponentials tells you that once you

have let's say 300 of those

cubits in what we call the fully

entangled state so you must be able able

to create these really crazy states

where there is a superposition of all

three unds being one way and another way

and another way and so on then you have

like two to the 300 classical bits which

is as many particles as there are in the

universe but there's a catch although

the cubits can exist in any combination

of States when they are measured they

must fall into one of the basis States

and all the other information about the

state before the measurement is lost so

you don't want generally to have as the

final result of your Quantum

computation something that is a very

complicated superposition of States

because you cannot measure a

superposition you can only measure one

of these basis States right like down

down up yeah so what you want is

to um design the logic operations that

you need to get to the final

computational result in such a way that

the final result is something you're

able to measure it's just a unique State

essenti that's not true that's not

trivial and it's essentially I'm kind of

stretching things here but I guess it's

to some degree the reason why quantum

computers are not a replacement for

classical computers they're not no

they're not they're not universally

faster they're only faster for special

types of calculations where you can use

the fact that you have all these Quantum

superpositions available to you at the

same time to do some kind of

computational

parallelism if you just want to watch a

video in high in high definition or

browse the internet or or write some

document in Word they're not going to

give you any particular um Improvement

if you need to use a classical algorithm

to get to the result so you should not

think of a quantum computer as something

where where every operation is faster in

fact every operation is probably going

to be slower than in the computer you

have on the desk but it's an a computer

where the number of operations required

to arrive at the result is exponentially

small so the Improvement is not in the

speed of the individual operation is in

the total number of operations you need

to arrive at the result but that is only

the case in particular types of

calculations in particular algorithms is

universally which is why it's not a

replacement of a classical

comp very positive voltage on here so

let's say you have a battery of about

let's say two

volts what this will do you see the
