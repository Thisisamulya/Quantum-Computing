# **The Vulnerability of RSA Encryption to Quantum Computing**

## **Introduction**

Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) encryption, a cornerstone of modern digital communication, provides security by transforming readable data into an unintelligible format that can only be reversed with a specific key 1. This method relies on the computational difficulty of solving certain mathematical problems using classical computers 2. However, the emergence of quantum computing presents a potential paradigm shift in computational power, threatening the security of widely used encryption algorithms like RSA 4. This report examines the fundamental principles of RSA encryption, the theoretical capability of quantum computers utilizing Shor's algorithm to compromise its security, the current state of quantum computing technology, the potential impact on cybersecurity, and the ongoing development of countermeasures in the form of post-quantum cryptography.

## **RSA Encryption Fundamentals**

RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that employs a pair of mathematically linked keys: a public key and a private key 2. The public key is freely available and used for encrypting messages, while the private key is kept confidential by the owner and is necessary for decryption 2. This system eliminates the need for prior key sharing, a significant advantage over traditional symmetric encryption methods 7. The security of RSA hinges on the generation of these keys, which involves selecting two large prime numbers, denoted as *p* and *q* 2. These primes are multiplied to produce a modulus *n*, which forms part of both the public and private keys 2. The public key consists of the pair (*n*, *e*), where *e* is the encryption exponent. The private key includes *n* and a decryption exponent *d*, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of *e* modulo φ(*n*), where φ(*n*) is Euler's totient function calculated as (*p* \- 1\) \* (*q* \- 1\) 6. Encryption involves raising the plaintext message *m* to the power of *e* and taking the modulus of *n* to obtain the ciphertext *C* (*C* \= *m*\<sup\>*e*\</sup\> mod *n*) 6. Decryption reverses this process by raising the ciphertext *C* to the power of *d* and taking the modulus of *n* to retrieve the original message *m* (*m* \= *C*\<sup\>*d*\</sup\> mod *n*) 6.

## **Mathematical Foundation of RSA Security**

The security of RSA encryption is fundamentally based on the computational difficulty of factoring large integers, specifically the modulus *n*, back into its original prime factors *p* and *q* 2. While multiplying two large prime numbers is a computationally straightforward task, reversing this process to find the prime factors of their product becomes exponentially harder as the size of the numbers increases 2. The RSA problem is defined as the task of recovering the original message given only the public key (*n*, *e*) and the ciphertext 11. The most efficient known classical method to solve this problem involves factoring the modulus *n* 11. The length of the RSA key, typically 1024 or 2048 bits, determines the size of the modulus *n*. Larger key lengths result in significantly larger numbers, making factorization practically infeasible for classical computers within a reasonable timeframe 2. For instance, factoring a 2048-bit number using classical methods would take an estimated 300 trillion years 12. This computational barrier is the cornerstone of RSA's security 3.

## **Shor's Algorithm**

In 1994, Peter Shor developed a quantum algorithm that possesses the theoretical capability to factorize large integers exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms 5. Shor's algorithm leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and quantum parallelism, to perform computations in a fundamentally different way than classical computers 4. The algorithm consists of two main stages: a classical reduction of the factorization problem to the problem of finding the period of a modular function, followed by the use of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) on a quantum computer to efficiently determine this period 5. Once the period is found, the prime factors of the original number can be derived through classical post-processing using techniques like Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor 13. The ability of Shor's algorithm to solve the integer factorization problem in polynomial time poses a direct threat to the security of RSA encryption, as it could potentially allow an attacker with a sufficiently powerful quantum computer to efficiently derive the private key from the public key 5.

## **Academic Research on Shor's Algorithm Breaking RSA**

Numerous academic research papers have explored the application of Shor's algorithm in the context of breaking RSA encryption 15. These studies highlight the theoretical vulnerability of RSA due to Shor's algorithm's efficiency in factoring large semi-primes, which are the product of two large prime numbers used in RSA key generation 4. Research emphasizes that while classical factorization methods become exponentially slower with increasing key size, Shor's algorithm offers an exponential speedup, potentially reducing the time required to break RSA from thousands of years to hours, given a sufficiently advanced quantum computer 12. Some papers delve into the implementation and analysis of Shor's algorithm, assessing its efficiency and the quantum resources required to factor numbers of cryptographic significance 4. These studies often discuss the challenges in building such quantum computers, including issues like error correction and decoherence, which affect the reliability of quantum computations 15.

## **Current State of Quantum Computing**

While the theoretical threat posed by Shor's algorithm is significant, the current state of quantum computing technology is not yet advanced enough to break RSA encryption with commonly used key lengths like 2048 bits 5. Current quantum computers are still in the early stages of development and face limitations in the number of stable and error-corrected qubits (quantum bits) they possess 19. Estimates for the number of logical qubits required to break RSA-2048 vary, ranging from around 4,000 to 20 million, depending on the specific algorithm implementation and assumptions about error correction 22. The largest number factored using Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer to date is 21 5. While there have been claims of breaking larger RSA keys using hybrid quantum-classical approaches with fewer qubits, these have generally involved significantly smaller key sizes (e.g., 22 bits) and do not yet pose a threat to standard RSA implementations 27. Experts generally agree that quantum computers capable of breaking RSA-2048 are still years, if not decades, away due to the substantial hardware and error correction challenges that need to be overcome 19.

## **Impact on Cybersecurity**

The eventual development of quantum computers capable of running Shor's algorithm at scale would have a profound impact on current cybersecurity practices 5. The ability to efficiently break RSA and other public-key encryption methods like Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) would render a significant portion of current online security infrastructure obsolete 31. This includes protocols used for secure web browsing (HTTPS), virtual private networks (VPNs), secure email communication, and digital signatures 7. Sensitive data encrypted with these methods, both currently in transit and stored for the long term, would become vulnerable to decryption by malicious actors 31. The timeline for this impact is a subject of ongoing debate among experts. While some predict that a cryptographically relevant quantum computer could emerge within the next 10-20 years, others estimate a longer timeframe, potentially 20-30 years or even beyond 2050 24. Given the potential for "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks, where adversaries collect encrypted data today with the intention of decrypting it in the future using quantum computers, it is crucial for organizations to begin preparing for this eventuality now 33.

## **Post-Quantum Cryptography**

In response to the looming threat posed by quantum computers, researchers and standardization bodies worldwide are actively developing and standardizing post-quantum cryptography (PQC), also known as quantum-resistant or quantum-safe cryptography 5. PQC aims to develop cryptographic algorithms that are secure against both classical and quantum computers 45. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been leading a global effort to solicit, evaluate, and standardize PQC algorithms since 2016 43. As of August 2024, NIST has finalized the first three PQC standards: CRYSTALS-Kyber (now ML-KEM) for key encapsulation, and CRYSTALS-Dilithium (now ML-DSA) and SPHINCS+ (now SLH-DSA) for digital signatures 41. These algorithms are based on different mathematical approaches, such as lattice-based cryptography and hash-based cryptography, which are believed to be resistant to known quantum attacks 5. The transition to PQC is a complex process that requires organizations to inventory their cryptographic assets, assess their vulnerability to quantum attacks, and develop a migration plan to adopt quantum-safe algorithms 31. Achieving crypto agility, the ability to quickly and seamlessly switch between cryptographic algorithms, is becoming increasingly important in preparing for the quantum era 33.

## **Conclusion**

Quantum computing presents a significant future threat to the security of RSA encryption due to the potential of Shor's algorithm to efficiently solve the underlying integer factorization problem. While current quantum computers are not yet capable of breaking RSA with standard key lengths, rapid advancements in the field necessitate proactive measures to mitigate this risk. The development and standardization of post-quantum cryptography algorithms offer a promising path towards ensuring continued secure digital communication in the quantum era. Organizations must begin to understand the implications of quantum computing for their cybersecurity posture and initiate the transition to quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions to safeguard sensitive data against future threats.
