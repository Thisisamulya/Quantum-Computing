\chapter*{Abstract}
Quantum computing has emerged as a revolutionary paradigm in computation, offering significant advantages over classical computing for certain types of problems. One of the most notable implications of quantum computing is its potential to break widely used cryptographic systems, such as RSA encryption. This report explores the principles of RSA encryption, the capabilities of quantum computing, and how quantum algorithms, particularly Shor's algorithm, pose a threat to the security of RSA. The report also discusses the implications of this threat and the need for quantum-resistant cryptographic systems.

\chapter{Introduction to RSA Encryption and Its Importance}
RSA encryption is a cornerstone of modern cryptography, widely used to secure digital communications. Its security is based on the computational difficulty of factoring large integers, a problem that classical computers find infeasible to solve within a reasonable timeframe. This chapter provides an overview of RSA encryption, its working principles, and its critical role in ensuring secure communication.

\chapter{Background on RSA Encryption and Its Vulnerabilities}
The existing cryptographic systems, including RSA, rely on the computational difficulty of certain mathematical problems, such as integer factorization. Classical computers are unable to solve these problems efficiently, which forms the basis of RSA's security. This chapter discusses the existing system and its reliance on classical computational limitations.

\chapter{Existing Methods for Breaking RSA Before Quantum Computing}
Before the advent of quantum computing, several classical methods were explored to break RSA encryption. These methods, while not as efficient as quantum algorithms, posed potential threats under certain conditions. This chapter discusses the existing systems and techniques used to attack RSA encryption prior to the emergence of quantum computing.

\section{Brute Force Attacks}
Brute force attacks involve systematically trying all possible private keys to decrypt a message. However, due to the large key sizes used in RSA (typically 2048 bits or more), brute force attacks are computationally infeasible with classical computers.

\section{Mathematical Factorization Algorithms}
The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers. Several classical algorithms have been developed to factorize numbers, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trial Division:} A basic method that tests divisibility by smaller numbers, but it is highly inefficient for large integers.
    \item \textbf{Pollard's Rho Algorithm:} A probabilistic algorithm that works well for smaller numbers but struggles with large RSA keys.
    \item \textbf{Quadratic Sieve:} One of the fastest classical algorithms for factoring integers up to 100 digits.
    \item \textbf{General Number Field Sieve (GNFS):} The most efficient classical algorithm for factoring large integers, used in practical attacks on RSA with smaller key sizes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Side-Channel Attacks}
Side-channel attacks exploit physical implementations of RSA rather than its mathematical foundation. Examples include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Timing Attacks:} Measuring the time taken for cryptographic operations to infer private keys.
    \item \textbf{Power Analysis:} Observing power consumption patterns during encryption or decryption.
    \item \textbf{Electromagnetic Analysis:} Capturing electromagnetic emissions to extract sensitive information.
\end{itemize}

\section{Distributed Computing Efforts}
Projects like the RSA Factoring Challenge encouraged distributed computing efforts to factorize RSA keys. While these efforts demonstrated the vulnerability of smaller key sizes, they were not practical for breaking modern RSA implementations with sufficiently large keys.

\section{Limitations of Classical Methods}
Despite these methods, breaking RSA encryption with classical computers remains infeasible for adequately large key sizes. The computational resources and time required grow exponentially with key size, ensuring the security of RSA against classical attacks.

While RSA encryption has been a reliable cryptographic standard, it is not without limitations. The primary challenge lies in its reliance on the difficulty of integer factorization. With the advent of quantum computing, this foundational assumption is under threat, as quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm can efficiently solve the integer factorization problem.

\chapter{Drawbacks of Existing Methods}
While existing methods for breaking RSA encryption have been extensively studied, they come with significant drawbacks that limit their practicality and effectiveness. This chapter discusses the key limitations of these methods:

\section{Brute Force Attacks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exponential Time Complexity:} The time required to test all possible keys grows exponentially with key size, making brute force attacks infeasible for modern RSA implementations.
    \item \textbf{Resource Intensive:} Brute force attacks require substantial computational resources, which are often unavailable or impractical to deploy.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical Factorization Algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inefficiency for Large Keys:} Classical factorization algorithms, such as the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS), become increasingly inefficient as the size of the RSA key increases.
    \item \textbf{High Computational Cost:} These algorithms demand significant computational power and time, limiting their applicability to smaller key sizes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Side-Channel Attacks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dependency on Physical Access:} Side-channel attacks often require physical access to the cryptographic device, which is not always feasible.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation Techniques:} Modern cryptographic implementations include countermeasures to reduce the effectiveness of side-channel attacks, such as constant-time algorithms and noise injection.
\end{itemize}

\section{Distributed Computing Efforts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalability Issues:} Distributed computing efforts face challenges in scaling to factorize larger RSA keys due to the exponential growth in computational requirements.
    \item \textbf{Coordination Overhead:} Managing and coordinating large-scale distributed systems introduces additional complexity and overhead.
\end{itemize}

\section{General Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reliance on Classical Computing:} All existing methods are constrained by the limitations of classical computing, which cannot efficiently solve the integer factorization problem for large key sizes.
    \item \textbf{Inability to Address Quantum Threats:} These methods do not account for the advancements in quantum computing, which pose a more significant threat to RSA encryption.
\end{itemize}

These drawbacks highlight the need for more advanced approaches, such as quantum-resistant cryptographic systems, to address the vulnerabilities of RSA encryption in the face of evolving computational capabilities.

\chapter{Quantum Computing: A Paradigm Shift}
Quantum computing represents a revolutionary shift in computational capabilities, leveraging principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. This chapter explores the basics of quantum computing and highlights how it differs from classical computing, particularly in solving problems like integer factorization.

\chapter{Shor's Algorithm and Its Impact on RSA}
Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can factorize large integers exponentially faster than classical algorithms. This chapter delves into the workings of Shor's algorithm and explains how it directly undermines the security of RSA encryption, making it vulnerable to quantum attacks.

\chapter{Implications of Quantum Computing on Cryptography}
